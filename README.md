## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Add items to the cart and remove them
- Increase/decrease the number of items in the cart
- See an order confirmation modal when they click "Confirm Order"
- Reset their selections when they click "Start New Order"
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### What I learned

This project provided an excellent opportunity to dive deeper into some of the key features of React and modern front-end development tools.

I was especially interested in building a single-page application (SPA), which led me to explore React Router for dynamic page navigation. This was my first experience with implementing routing in a React project, and I found it both challenging and rewarding.

Additionally, I had heard about Vite being a faster, more modern alternative to Create React App (CRA), so I decided to use it for this project. The performance improvements and streamlined development process were clear from the start, making it a great choice.

This is only my second React project, and while my last project used PropTypes for type checking, I wanted to step up my game. After reading how most React developers prefer TypeScript for its type safety and tooling, I decided to integrate TypeScript into my workflow for future projects.

In summary, this project introduced me to and helped me implement the following technologies and concepts:

	-	React Router for navigation in a single-page application
	-	Vite as a fast, modern build tool
	-	TypeScript as a superior alternative to PropTypes for type safety

### Continued development

Moving forward, I would like to dive deeper into testing. As I approached the end of this project and started refining the code, I noticed that small changes in one area could cause unexpected issues elsewhere. This experience highlighted the importance of having robust tests in place early on to catch these issues before they become bigger problems.

My goal is to explore unit testing for individual components and end-to-end testing to ensure the overall user experience works as expected.

In addition to testing, I’m also eager to work more with API calls in my next project. I’ve heard great things about Axios as a popular and efficient library for handling HTTP requests, and I plan to use it for making API calls and managing data flow between the front end and back end.
